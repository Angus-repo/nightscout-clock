# Nightscout Clock

## This project is in a work-in-progress state

Nightscout Clock (or NSClock) is a custom firmware for [Ulanzi TC001](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005531845548.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.33.3aa11802BcFCFy) allowing it to connect to Nightscout server, read blood glucose values and show them on the matrix screen

The code is heavily inspired by (has a lot of copy-pasted code from :D ) [AWTRIX Light](https://github.com/Blueforcer/awtrix-light) project.
